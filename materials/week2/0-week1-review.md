1. **Good places to start learning Python include:**
    * The official [Python tutorial][python tutorial link] for a quick start guide.
    * If you're a __MATLAB__ user, the [Numpy for MATLAB users][numpy for matlab link] documentation.
    * ... and if you're a language stickler, check out the [Python style guide][pep 8 link].


2. **We recommend installing Python 3.x, as Python 2.7 is [no longer being updated][python 2 vs 3 link].**


3. **We installed a Python 3.x distribution by way of [Anaconda][anaconda link].**
    * One of the most useful aspects of Anaconda is [`conda`][conda link].
        * `conda` is an open source package manager that keeps all Python dependencies in check
        * Maybe the best part:  It doesn't require root permission to install, so you can always have a trustworthy Python installation on a remote machine
        * Check out the [conda cheatsheet][conda cheatsheet link] to get familiar with it

4. **We learned how to create a git repository.**
    * Review the materials [here](https://github.com/bairdlangenbrunner/ESS-Python-Tutorial/tree/master/materials/week1).
    * One application:  clone this repository by typing the following into your local directory of choice:

```git clone https://github.com/bairdlangenbrunner/ESS-Python-Tutorial```


5. **We opened our first [Jupyter Notebook][what is jupyter notebook link].  To do this, type `jupyter notebook` on the command line.  It will pop up in your default web browser.**
    * You can also open it using the Anaconda Navigator app that comes installed with Anaconda.  Click on the Jupyter Notebook "launch" link.
    * Finally, remember you can also run Python from a terminal by simply typing `python`, or using [Interactive Python][interactive python link] by typing `ipython` on the command line.  Quit a Python session by typing `exit()` and hitting `enter/return`.
